This is about deploying azure resources with Bicep from ci/cd pipeline . 

We will deploy these resources :
1. Resource Group 
2. Storage account 
3. Virtual machine

I will provision these resources to make sure they work as connector .

Resource group - baiscally a container in Azure that holds related resources for a project , application or environment.
