Step 1: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
VPC (Public/Private Subnets)

Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway

Security Groups for ECS, RDS

RDS PostgreSQL instance or DynamoDB

Output VPC and subnet IDs for CDK to consume

Step 2: Deploy Application with AWS CDK
Use VPC and subnet IDs from Terraform

ECS Cluster with Fargate Service

Flask API Dockerized and pushed to ECR

Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of Fargate tasks

S3 bucket for frontend, CloudFront distribution

Step 3: Setup Monitoring with CloudWatch
Log groups for ECS

Application-level logging (Flask or Node.js → stdout → CloudWatch)

CloudWatch Alarms:

High CPU or Memory on ECS

5xx responses from ALB

DB connection errors

Optional CloudWatch Dashboard
